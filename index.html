    <h2>1. Persona 5</h2>

        <br><cite>Photo by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1687950/Persona_5_Royal/"
                              target="_blank">Steam</a> </cite>.</p>
    <p class=description>P5 was a defining part of my high school year. It gave me the confidence to stand up to
        injustice
        as well as gave me a story that I have fond memories of. Following a protaganist who was banished to Tokyo for a
        crime
        he diddn't commit, he seeks to gather a band of Phantom Thieves to change the hearts of corrupt adults.
        From the gameplay, story, music, and UI, Persona 5 is a standout hit that got me into Japanese turn-based RPGs.
        A massive recommend from me.</p>

    <h2>2. Limbus Company</h2>
    <p><img src="limbuscompany.jpg" alt="Limbus Company">
        <br><cite>Photo by
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1973530/Limbus_Company/" target="_blank">Steam</a>
        </cite>.</p>
    <p class=description>I came into this live-service game with no expectations and was greatly surprised. Limbus
        Company
        is a Korean turn-based live service RPG. As the Executive Manager of Limbus Company, you lead your group of
        twelve
        Sinners based off of classic literature. It's an immensely emotional and dramatic story with amazing art and
        music.</p>

    <h2>3. NieR: Automata</h2>
    <p><img src="nierautomata.jpg" alt="NieR Automata">
        <br><cite>Photo by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/524220/NieRAutomata/"
                              target="_blank">Steam</a></cite>.</p>
    <p class=description>NieR: Automata is WEIRD. But in a good way! A JRPG with an emphasis on action with a diverse
        combat system, the story is about searching for meaning in a meaningless world, as the Androids fight
        off the Machines in service of Humanity. With three different routes of the game, there's plenty of strangeness
        to
        encounter here.</p>

    <h2>4. Fate/Grand Order</h2>
    <p><img src="fgo.jpg" width="625px" alt="Fate/Grand Order">
        <br><cite>Photo by <a href="https://mmoculture.com/2017/05/fategrand-order-popular-mobile-game-launches-in-
        taiwan-next-week/" target="_blank">MMOCulture</a> </cite>.</p>
    <p class="description">FGO is the longest live-service game I've played. Written by a legendary Japanese writer, it
        is well known for the richness of its story that uses a variety of anime interpretations of historical figures
        to
        do battle. Due to its gacha mechanics, I struggle to recommend it to others, but it's a great game!</p>

    <h2>5. Hades</h2>
    <p><img src="hades.jpg" width="625px" alt="Hades">
        <br><cite>Photo by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145360/Hades/" target="_blank">Steam</a> </cite>.
    </p>
    <p class="description">An action-based roguelike, Hades is a reverse-Orpheus story about Zagreus, a god escaping to
        the surface while Hades, his father tries to prevent him from doing so. It seems hard at first, and you
        are expected to die a lot. However, you eventually learn the enemy attack patterns after fighting and dying to
        them over and over. It's a really great game if you have a lot of time to spend.</p>
